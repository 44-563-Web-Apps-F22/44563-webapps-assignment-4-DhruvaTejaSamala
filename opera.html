    <p><pre>  CHORUS

        Oh, dry the glist'ning tear
             That dews that martial cheek,
        Thy loving children hear,
             In them thy comfort seek.
        With sympathetic care
             Their arms around thee creep,
        For oh, they cannot bear
             To see their father weep!

   (Enter MABEL)

                          SOLOâ€”MABEL

        Dear father, why leave your bed
             At this untimely hour,
        When happy daylight is dead,
             And darksome dangers low'r?
        See, heav'n has lit her lamp,
             The midnight hour is past,
        And the chilly night-air is damp,
             And the dews are falling fast!
        Dear father, why leave your bed
             When happy daylight is dead?

GIRLS:    Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.

   (FREDERIC enters)

MABEL:    Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
        your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
        something that will relieve my father's sorrow?
FREDERIC: I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
        after night, in this draughty old ruin?
GENERAL:  Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
        clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
        help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
        before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
        pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
        escutcheon.
FREDERIC: But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
        year ago, and the stucco on your baronial castle is
        scarcely dry.
GENERAL:  Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors: you cannot deny
        that.  With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
        contents.  I don't know whose ancestors they were, but
        I know whose ancestors they are, and I shudder to think
        that their descendant by purchase (if I may so describe
        myself) should have brought disgrace upon what, I have
        no doubt, was an unstained escutcheon.
FREDERIC: Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
        reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
        clergyman, and have married your large family on the
        spot.</pre></p>
