    <h3>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE<br>
        OR<br>
        THE SLAVE OF DUTY<br>
        DRAMATIS PERSONA</h3>
    <h4 class="act">ACT II</h4>
        <p class = "scene">Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.  Aisles C., R. and L.,
             divided by pillars and arches, ruined Gothic windows at
             back.<br>  MAJOR-GENERAL STANLEY discovered seated R.C.
             pensively, surrounded by his daughters.</p>
    <h4 class = "chorus">CHORUS</h4>

     <p class = "song">Oh, dry the glist'ning tear<br>
             That dews that martial cheek,<br>
        Thy loving children hear,<br>
             In them thy comfort seek.<br>
        With sympathetic care<br>
             Their arms around thee creep,<br>
        For oh, they cannot bear<br>
             To see their father weep!</p>

<p class = "directions">(Enter MABEL)</p>

       <h4 p class = "MABEL">SOLO—MABEL</h4>

        <p class="song">Dear father, why leave your bed<br>
             At this untimely hour,<br>
        When happy daylight is dead,<br>
             And darksome dangers low'r?<br>
        See, heav'n has lit her lamp,<br>
             The midnight hour is past,<br>
        And the chilly night-air is damp,<br>
             And the dews are falling fast!<br>
        Dear father, why leave your bed<br>
             When happy daylight is dead?</p>

<h4 class = "GIRLS">GIRLS: </h4> <p> Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.</p>

   <p class = "directions">(FREDERIC enters)</p>

   <h4 class = "MABEL">MABEL: </h4>
       <p class = "speech">Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
        your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
        something that will relieve my father's sorrow?</p>
<h4 class = "FREDERIC">FREDERIC: </h4>
       <p class = "speech">I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
        after night, in this draughty old ruin?</p>
<h4 class = "GENERAL">GENERAL: </h4>
       <p class = "speech">Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
        clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
        help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
        before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
        pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
        escutcheon.</p>
<h4 class = "FREDERIC">FREDERIC: </h4><p class = "speech">But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
        year ago, and the stucco on your baronial castle is
        scarcely dry.</p>
<h4 class = "GENERAL">GENERAL: </h4><p class = "speech">Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors: you cannot deny
        that.  With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
        contents.  I don't know whose ancestors they were, but
        I know whose ancestors they are, and I shudder to think
        that their descendant by purchase (if I may so describe
        myself) should have brought disgrace upon what, I have
        no doubt, was an unstained escutcheon.</p>
<h4 class = "FREDERIC">FREDERIC: </h4><p class = "speech">Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
        reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
        clergyman, and have married your large family on the
        spot.</p>
<h4 class = "GENERAL">GENERAL:  </h4><p class = "speech">I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is
        unavailing.  I assure you, Frederic, that such is the
        anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
        by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates, that I
        would go to their simple-minded chief this very night
        and confess all, did I not fear that the consequences
        would be most disastrous to myself.  At what time does
        your expedition march against these scoundrels?</p>
